    <h1> MY NAME IS PAUL KITONYI</h1>
    <h2>My  Work In Mig Welding</h2>
    <p>Metal Inert Gas (MIG) welding is an arc welding process.A MIG welder automatically feeds an electrically charged,
       solid wire into the weld joint at a set speed,and the supplied gas shields the molten pool.
       The short circuit transfer method is the most commonly used. But there are four primary methods of metal transfer 
       possible with GMAW:Short-circuiting,Globular,Spray,Pulsed-spray</p>
    <h3>My Work with Metal Cutting Band Saw</h3>
    <p>A band saw is an automated sawing machine where the saw blade is welded into a continuous loop and passed along a pulley system
        All band saws work though basically identical processes.Below are five benefits or reasons many people consider the bandsaw as one of the most useful tools in the shop. For easy ideas see DIY bandsaw projects.<p> 
    <h4>My work in electronic tool kit</h4>
    <p>When implemented correctly, the following tools help IT professionals operate at peak performance:Project management software,
       Inventory and asset management (ITAM) software,Document management software,Vulnerability management software,Help desk software 2</p>
    <h5>This is a hand saw 3</h5>
    <p>As the name suggests, this type of saw is used to cut the workpiece across the grain of the wood. This type of saw has a similar blade length as the rip cut but has more teeth with 8 to 11 per inch.The fine teeth leave a smoother edge behind compared to the rip cut.
       There’s a reason why hand saws have remained pretty much unchanged for thousands of years. They’re easy to use, affordable, and unlike power saws like jigsaws and reciprocating saws, they aren’t reliant on batteries or power access. Although hand saws do require some user effort, their ergonomic handles and elongated blades allow you to power through materials quickly and efficiently.</p>
